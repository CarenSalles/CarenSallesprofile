Hello there! 😊
In Brazil I graduated as Deck Officer of Merchant Marine and worked for 10 years maneuvering ships.🚢
I'm currently learnig Web Fullstack Developing in Factoría F5 Bootcamp to be able to be a Junior Coder. 🙌😉
I'm looking to empower myself in this area of web developer, because I believe it will be a great opportunity in these current times where almost everything revolves around the digital transformation that came with the creation of the internet.😅
I hope that here I can collaborate and seek knowledge through the exchange of information with the members of this network.🤞
In my free time I like to watch a good movie, listen to music, run, travel and enjoy good times with my family being at sea.👨‍👩‍👧
